# Risk Profile: Story 1.8

Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 31/100 (high risk implementation requiring careful mitigation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### SEC-001: Admin Authentication Bypass or Privilege Escalation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Admin access is a prime target for attackers, and adding admin roles to existing auth system increases complexity and potential for flaws.
**Impact**: High - Could allow unauthorized access to all user data, system controls, and potentially compromise the entire platform.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Use role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Comprehensive input validation on admin forms
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with OWASP ZAP, manual penetration testing of admin login, unit tests for auth middleware, integration tests for role assignment

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for admin authentication and authorization
- Backup and restore validation with data integrity checks
- Audit logging verification for all admin actions
- Integration testing for auth system modifications

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing for audit log queries under load
- Load testing for admin dashboard with large datasets
- Database query optimization validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- UI testing for admin interface usability
- Basic system monitoring validation
- Content moderation tool testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data integrity

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (additional monitoring)
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Minor admin usability issues can be addressed in follow-up iterations

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Failed admin login attempts and suspicious patterns
- Backup success rates and restore test results
- Audit query performance metrics
- Admin action logs for compliance
- System monitoring alert effectiveness

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Security vulnerabilities discovered in admin system
- Performance issues reported with admin features
- Admin feature usage patterns indicate scaling needs
- Regulatory requirements change for data handling
- New admin features are added
