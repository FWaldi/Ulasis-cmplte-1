# Risk Profile: Story 1.9

Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 10
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: API integration failures

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple API endpoints need to be replaced from mock to real, increasing chance of integration errors
**Impact**: High - Could break entire application functionality if API calls fail
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive API integration testing before deployment
- Add fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Use feature flags to gradually roll out real API calls
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for all API service functions, E2E tests for critical user flows

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- API integration failure scenarios
- Authentication flow with real JWT tokens
- Subscription limit enforcement
- Anonymous response rate limiting
- Required test types: Integration, E2E, Security testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Bubble analytics data processing
- Error boundary functionality
- Loading state management

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance monitoring

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Minimal performance risks for bubble analytics generation (score 1)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- API response times and error rates
- Authentication success/failure metrics
- Anonymous response submission rates
- Subscription limit usage patterns
- Bubble analytics performance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API endpoints change
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- New integrations added
