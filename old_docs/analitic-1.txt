🌐 Web Dashboard Components1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) CardsThese are the four individual blocks at the top, typically implemented as separate, reusable card components.Component Type: Info Card / Stat CardData Display:Main Value: Large, bold number (e.g., 1,287) for the primary metric.Label: Smaller text describing the metric (e.g., Total Responses).Comparison/Trend: A small number and arrow indicating change vs. a previous period (e.g., $\uparrow +2.5\%$ vs. last week).Technologies:Frontend Framework: React, Vue, Angular, or a dedicated component library.CSS: Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout; specific styling for bolding and color-coding the trend indicators (green for positive, red for negative).2. Weekly Performance Trends (Line Chart)This is a single, complex Interactive Line Chart Component.Component Type: Dual-Axis Line GraphVisualization Features:Chart Library: Utilizes libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, Plotly, or a commercial charting package to render the SVG or Canvas graphic.Dual Y-Axes: One axis for Avg. Rating (left, e.g., 0-36) and a second axis for Response Rate (%) (right, e.g., 0-8).Data Series: Two distinct lines with different colors/markers ($\color{#FFA500}{\text{yellow/orange}}$ for Rating, $\color{#008000}{\text{green}}$ for Response Rate).X-Axis: Categorical time scale (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun).Interactivity: Should support tooltips on hover to show exact values for both metrics on a specific day.3. Detailed Breakdown (Data Table)This is the largest and most data-dense element, requiring a robust Table Component.Component Type: Data Table / GridTable Features:Header & Rows: Clear headers (Improvement Area, Avg. Rating, Responses, Trend (WoW), Status).Data Formatting: The Avg. Rating column is formatted as a fraction (e.g., 4.8 / 5). The Trend (WoW) column includes a colored arrow and percentage.Status Indicators: The Status column uses Badges or Pills with color-coding (green for Good, yellow for Monitor, red for Urgent) for quick visual scanning.Interactivity (Potential): In a web app, this table would ideally be sortable by any column (e.g., sort by Avg. Rating to see the lowest scores first) and potentially filterable.Technologies: Often uses dedicated table libraries (like AG-Grid or table components from libraries like Material-UI) to handle large datasets and features like sorting/pagination.4. Overall Structure and LayoutThe entire presentation is housed within a Dashboard Layout Component.Layout Structure: A clear, responsive layout that arranges the KPI cards at the top (likely using a CSS Grid for a 4-column layout) and stacks the larger chart and table components below.Styling: Uses a clean, minimalist design with a white background and subtle gray borders to define the different component areas.
