E2E UI Test Findings - Debug Test 6

Date: Sat Nov 01 2025

Project: Ulasis Frontend

Test Framework: Playwright

Command Executed: npx playwright test (from Frontend directory)

Findings:

1. **Critical Issue: JSX Syntax Error**
   - The application failed to start due to a syntax error in DashboardIntegrated.tsx
   - Error: "Unterminated JSX contents" at line 214:14
   - File: D:\App_Project\Website\BMad-Methods\project-5\Ulasis\Frontend\src\components\dashboard\DashboardIntegrated.tsx
   - Specific error: Missing closing tag or malformed JSX structure around line 214

2. **Test Execution Status**
   - Tests attempted to run (27 tests detected across multiple browsers: chromium, firefox, webkit)
   - Dev server (Vite) started but crashed repeatedly due to the JSX error
   - No tests completed successfully
   - Command timed out after 60 seconds

3. **Root Cause**
   - The e2e tests require the application to be running on localhost:3001
   - The webServer configuration in playwright.config.ts starts 'npm run dev' to serve the app
   - Due to the syntax error, the dev server cannot compile and serve the application
   - Therefore, tests cannot access the UI to perform e2e interactions

4. **Recommendations**
   - Fix the JSX syntax error in DashboardIntegrated.tsx before running e2e tests
   - Check for missing closing tags, unmatched brackets, or other JSX formatting issues
   - Run 'npm run dev' manually to verify the app starts without errors
   - Once fixed, re-run the e2e tests

5. **Test Coverage Detected**
   - Based on the test file login.spec.ts, tests cover:
     - Landing page loading
     - Navigation to login
     - Successful login
     - Demo mode entry
     - Analytics viewing in demo mode
     - Anonymous response submission
     - QR code generation
     - Questionnaire creation in demo mode

Note: All tests are currently blocked by the build error and cannot be executed until the syntax issue is resolved.
