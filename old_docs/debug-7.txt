# Todo List for Frontend-Backend-Database Integration Fixes
# Based on audit-p-1.txt analysis to achieve 100% communication and local usability

## High Priority Tasks
- [x] Fix API base URL in apiService.ts from port 3001 to 3000 to match backend
- [x] Consolidate auth services by merging authService.ts and apiService.ts auth methods into single service using axios
- [x] Migrate questionnaireService.ts and authService.ts from fetch to axios for consistency
- [x] Set up local database (SQLite for testing) and run migrations
- [x] Ensure backend server starts on port 3000 and handles all API routes correctly
- [x] Test full frontend-backend-database integration with API calls, auth, and data persistence

## Medium Priority Tasks
- [x] Ensure all frontend services use VITE_API_BASE_URL environment variable
- [x] Implement consistent error handling across all services with unified error formats
- [x] Unify token storage keys and implement token refresh logic across all services

## Low Priority Tasks
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for all API responses and requests

## Notes
- These tasks address the audit's identified issues for reliable local development
- Start with high priority items to fix core communication problems
- Test after each major change to ensure integration works
