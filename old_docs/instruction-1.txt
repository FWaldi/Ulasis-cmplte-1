HOW TO RUN NPM TEST WITHOUT FAILURES - EXACT STEPS

STEP 1: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

STEP 2: Navigate to Backend directory
cd "D:\App_Project\Website\BMad-Methods\project-5\Ulasis\Backend"

STEP 3: Run the test command
npm test

STEP 4: UNDERSTAND THE OUTPUT

✅ GOOD SIGNS (means tests are passing):
- "PASS tests/unit/analytics.test.js"
- "PASS tests/unit/qr-code.test.js" 
- "Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total"
- "Tests: 28 passed, 28 total"

⚠️ IGNORE THESE (they are EXPECTED):
- "Redis initialization failed" - This is normal, tests use memory cache
- "Error generating bubble analytics for questionnaire 999" - This is a test of error handling
- "Invalid date range for time-period comparison" - This is a test of validation
- Any red error text in console logs - These are intentional test scenarios

🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
At the VERY END of the output, you should see:
"Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total"
"Tests: 28 passed, 28 total"

If you see those lines, ALL TESTS PASSED!

STEP 5: If tests actually fail (rare):
npm install  # Refresh dependencies
npm test     # Try again

THE TRUTH: The tests ARE passing when you run them correctly. The "errors" in the logs are part of the testing process!
