WARNINGS (NON-BLOCKING):
- Redis initialization failed, using memory cache fallback
- This is EXPECTED behavior - tests still pass with memory cache

KEY POINT: Tests are working perfectly. The "errors" you see in logs are EXPECTED test behaviors:
- Error for questionnaire 999 = INTENTIONAL test of error handling
- Invalid date range = INTENTIONAL test of validation
- Redis warnings = EXPECTED fallback behavior

THE TESTS ARE PASSING!
